# EfiGuard Usermode BootLoader
This is a UserMode BootLoader for EfiGuard and other EFI based bootkits. It uses dumped files (EasyUEFI) to set the boot entries and manage them. It only uses temporary boot entries so after restarting and not loading it will not load EFIGuard or your other EFI Files.
